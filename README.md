**Overview**

This program supports the operation of a platform (eBikeIUL) designed for managing a fleet of bicycles, both manual and electric, spread across the Iscte campus, aiming to facilitate short-distance travel and leisure activities. Functionally, users register on the eBikeIUL application by choosing a nickname and password, which they will then use to reserve and use the eBikeIULs scattered around the campus. When the user reaches the vehicle, they can start the rental, which will unlock its wheels and allow the user to ride it, marking the vehicle as occupied. When they finish their activity, the user uses the application again to end the rental, performing the opposite operation, locking the vehicle's wheels and marking it as available. The program encompasses the following concepts/functionalities:

* Vehicle: means of transport (electric or manual bicycle) used by the user. All vehicles have a name, generally corresponding to the name of an animal.
* User: person who can rent an eBikeIUL, currently restricted to Iscte students.
* Rental: record that contains information about a specific rental.
* Manager: eBikeIUL platform, which allows managing vehicles, users, and rentals.
